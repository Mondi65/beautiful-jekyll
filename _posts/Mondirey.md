Certificated scrum master (CSM), scrum product owner (CSPO), scaled agile practitioner (SAFe), project management master certificate. 

I’m a strategic and intuitive program manager with 20+ years' experience managing large scale, highly complex multibillion-dollar programs.   

My focus begins and ends with the customer in mind.  I ask the right questions to understand customer needs, simplify, prioritize and deliver the highest value early and often with unwavering customer satisfaction.  

I'm curious, with a value driven mindset. I love the feeling of finding strategic solutions to the most complex and challenging problems - the feeling is then amplified when it's accomplished in a collaborative and inclusive environment. 

Specialties include waterfall and agile discipline and best practices, scrum, Kanban, lean, program planning and execution, agile transformation, rhythm of business, program governance, change management, c-suite reporting and support, risk mitigation, data analytics, cross-functional collaboration and customer success.   

Proficient in English and Arabic.
